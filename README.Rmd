The R Script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

    1. Downloads the UCI HAR dataset
    2. Reads and cleans the activity labels and features
    3. Reads the training and test datasets
    4. Keeps only the variables from the training and test datasets that              mention a mean or standard deviation
    5. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    6. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    7. Adds descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    8. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each           variable for each activity and each subject and names it                      second_tiny_data_set.txt
